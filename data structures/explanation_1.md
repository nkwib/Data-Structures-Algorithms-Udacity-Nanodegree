## Problem 1
##### Time Complexity: O(1)
##### Space Complexity: O(n) where n=size of Cache
I've used a ***dictionary*** to get and set the value at a selected key (They both have a runtime of O(1)) while using a ***double linked list*** to arrange the elements from the most recently requested (start) till the less recently one (tail). 

I've implemented just the methods that were necessary to the ***double linked list***.
