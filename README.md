### Udacity-Nanodegree


![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](banner.png)
This is a collection of the Projects requested for the completion of the Nanodegree in data structures and algorithms. I haven't optimized the code too much since I wanted to complete the program as fast as possible, but the solutions are good enough and fully respect the specifications of the projects.

For those interested in taking this you can find more info [Here](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-nanodegree--nd256)
