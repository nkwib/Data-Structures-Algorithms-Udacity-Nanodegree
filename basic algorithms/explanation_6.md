## Problem 6
##### Time Complexity: O(n)
##### Space Complexity: O(1)

A simple algorithm that stores two values (min and max) and change them when a number is less the min or higher than max. the time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(1).
when the array is empty it returns an empty tuple.
