## Problem 1
##### Time Complexity: O(1)
##### Space Complexity: O(1)

I guess that this is a simpler solution than what you expected but it does satisfy all the requirements of not using any library and the `**` operator would have been used anyway.

Since the square root is written as a power of one-half, taking the `int()` of the result gives us the floor of the squared number.
